# **OpenRouter.ai**

OpenRouter.ai is a platform that lets you access, compare, and use many different AI models from different providers, all in one place. In simple terms, it works like a **hub** for AI models, allowing you to choose from a variety of open-source and commercial models through a single interface or API.

It gives you the flexibility to test models, check performance, switch providers instantly, and even filter for **free models**, all without needing to sign up for multiple accounts across different companies.


## **Key Benefits**


### **Centralized Access**

Instead of jumping between multiple websites, you can browse and use models from companies like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and others in one place. Everything is organized in a single dashboard.


### **Easy Model Comparison**

OpenRouter displays model rankings, pricing, speed, and token limits. \
This makes it simple to see which model is faster, cheaper, or smarter for your task, no guessing needed.


### **Flexible Pricing + Free Models**

Many models on OpenRouter are free to use. You can filter specifically for models marked as **(free)** and start using them immediately.

If you're experimenting, learning, or working on small projects, the free-tier models can be enough without any cost.


### **Unified API**

OpenRouter provides a single API format that works across all models. \
You don’t need a different API style for each provider—everything follows one consistent structure.

This makes development easier and reduces time spent on configuration.


### **Web Chat Interface**

You can also chat with the models directly in your browser, similar to ChatGPT, but with the option to switch models instantly.
